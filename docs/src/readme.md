# The nrelay user guide

This book aims to be the go to resource for nrelay documentation.

If you've never used nrelay before, start with the [Getting started](getting-started/readme.md) chapter.

If you've already got nrelay installed and are keen to write your first plugin, check out the [Creating plugins](creating-plugins/creating-a-plugin.md) chapter.

If you're a seasoned user and are just coming here for reference, you're probably looking for the [Helpful links](helpful-links.md) page!
