# Migration guides

The migration guides describe the changes to the nrelay API which have occurred between two major versions.

They can be used as a reference or guide when upgrading old plugins to a newer version of nrelay.

**Note:** The migration guides are not exhaustive lists of all of the changes that have occurred, they mostly just cover the major changes.
